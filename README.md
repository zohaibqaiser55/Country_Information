In this project i have to use 3 patterns which is named as follows 
1) MVC:

MVC stands for Model, View and Controller. MVC separates application into three components - Model, View and Controller. Model: Model represents shape of the data and business logic. It maintains the data of the application. Model objects retrieve and store model state in a database.

In this my Model is Country_Body class, View is CountryInterface, Controller is Country main class.

2) ProtoType:

Implementation through Interface is count in ProtoType Patterns so you can see how i am using interface for all methods Declaration.

3) DAO:

this pattern is basically used to prevent data from customer directly so we can use DAO and in DAO there is also a interface which is used and by this we only tackle with Object to prevent data from Client directly.
